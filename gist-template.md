# Introduction to Regular Expression (Regex): Matching An Email

In this tutorial, we will explore the use of a regular expression (regex) pattern to validate and match email addresses. This regex pattern, /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/, can be employed in various contexts, such as within Node.js applications using libraries like Inquirer or when working with MongoDB databases.

## Summary

Through the use of regex patterns, you are able to efficiently validate an email adress to confirm and ensure they follow the standard format. This method is particularly useful when building larger applications in Node.js or working with mass amounts of data in MongoDB. These are areas where email validation becomes an important part of data integrity and security.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
The regex pattern, `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`, is made to match up with email address within the given string. This pattern can be utilized in various methods such as Node.js, or Inquirer and MongoDB.

- `^` (caret): This symbol represents the start of the string. This indicates that the email address must commence at the very start of the string.
- `$` (dollar sign): This symbol represents the end of the string which indicates that the email address must conclude at the very end of the string.

This pattern in constructed in a method of where it requests the entire email address to follow a specific format from start to finish without counting any characters before and after. By utilizing this regex pattern, you are able to validate any email address to ensure they follow the standard format.
