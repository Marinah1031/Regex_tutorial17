# Introduction to Regex: Matching An Email

In this tutorial, we will explore the use of a regular expression (regex) pattern to validate and match email addresses. This regex pattern, /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/, can be employed in various contexts, such as within Node.js applications using libraries like Inquirer or when working with MongoDB databases.
