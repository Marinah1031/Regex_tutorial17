# Introduction to Regex: Matching An Email

In this tutorial, we will explore the use of a regular expression (regex) pattern to validate and match email addresses. This regex pattern, /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/, can be employed in various contexts, such as within Node.js applications using libraries like Inquirer or when working with MongoDB databases.

## Summary

Through the use of regex patterns, you are able to efficiently validate an email adress to confirm and ensure they follow the standard format. This method is particularly useful when building larger applications in Node.js or working with mass amounts of data in MongoDB. These are areas where email validation becomes an important part of data integrity and security.
